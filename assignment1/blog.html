    <li>Challenges<p>Starting this assignment, I didn't really know how to insert an image into my 
                    webpage. Luckily, I was able to find an example online of an image in an html 
                    file and replicate this for my assignment</p></li>
    <li>What I learned<p>During this assignment, I learned how to insert pictures in my html files, and how to create lists. 
                        I already knew how to create paragraphs, and what the basic structure of an html file is.
                        </p></li>
    <li><p>I used stack overflow for the part of the assignment I had trouble with, I did not use any of the class resources.</p></li>
